## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed in your environment.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [![official Node.js website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [![official Node.js website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) and the [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white)](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v18.8.0

    $ npm --version
    8.18.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

### TODO

- Make a new Icon
